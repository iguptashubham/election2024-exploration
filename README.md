If you are highly active on Facebook and Instagram, you must have seen ads based on elections by any of the political parties, especially BJP and INC. All the parties in India usually spend a lot of money on election campaigns. I recently collected data from Meta ads about how much money was spent on Instagram and Facebook ads by each political party during the Indian elections 2024 in each state. In this article, we perform elections ad spending analysis using Python and how it impacted the voting patterns.

# Summary

Overall, the analyses indicate that higher ad spend does not guarantee higher voter turnout and voter engagement is influenced by various other factors. Larger and more significant states tend to spend more on ads, but this does not necessarily translate to higher voter participation. Political parties, particularly the BJP, invest heavily in advertising, yet the effectiveness of this spending in increasing voter turnout is questionable.
